# Foosballed

Available at: https://drdeus.itch.io/foosballed

Welcome to "Foosballed," a unique twist on the classic foosball game! In this exciting arcade-style game, you don't control the players â€“ you control the ball! 

Get ready to bounce your way to victory against an intelligent AI with adjustable difficulty. Vibrant, colourful, fast paced action, backed with an energetic electronic soundtrack!

> For macOS and iOS users:
> Due to [limitations with WebGL 2.0](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/export/exporting_for_web.html) there are some issues with running this on macOS. The game will take several minutes to load, the page will time out and the browser will freeze, but it will eventually load the game. Then after the game has loaded you will need to wait another minute before it plays correctly. (If you get a popup saying the page has frozen, select wait)

Made solo in 2 days for the [GMTK 2023 Game Jam!](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2023) Using the [Godot 4](https://godotengine.org/) game engine.
